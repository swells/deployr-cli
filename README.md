## Overview

DeployR CLI is a [Command Line Tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for running useful 
[DeployR](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com) utilities. Although the 
current feature set is minimal, many more CLI commands will be added going 
forward.

## Prerequisites

- Install the latest stable version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (version 0.10.x).
- A running [DeployR](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/admin/install) server to connect to.

**Note** to Windows users that have the [Microsoft HPC Pack](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc853440%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). 

If your environment has the Microsoft HPC Pack, the `node.exe` from Node.js can
conflict with the `node.exe` from the Microsoft HPC Pack (same name). You can 
view the [open issue](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/7773) here.

The current solution is to manually reorder the paths in the `PATH` environment 
variable giving Node.js's path a higher priority after installation.

## Installation

The DeployR CLI is installed and managed via [npm](http://npmjs.org), the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) package manager.

To get started, you will want to install the DeployR command line interface (CLI) 
globally. You may need to use sudo for (OSX, *nix, BSD, etc). If you are using 
Windows, run your command shell as Administrator.

One-line install using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
npm install -g deployr-cli
```

This will put the `di` command in your system path allowing it to be run from 
any location.

## Usage

DeployR CLI is self documenting and the best way to become familiar with the tool is to 
try it out from your command line:

```
di <resource> <action> <param1> <param2> ...
```

### Commands

 Command                                     | Purpose

 `di logout`                                 | Log out of DeployR.
 `di whoami`                                 | Displays the current logged in user to DeployR.
 `di install example`                        | Install a pre-built example.
 `di install example <name>`                 | Install a pre-built example by example name.
 `di about`                                  | Displays DeployR server information based on the set server `endpoint`.
 `di config`                                 | Allow you to edit your local `di` [configuration](#diconf-file) file.
 `di config list`                            | Lists all configuration values currently set in the configuration file.
 `di config set    <key> <value>`            | Sets the specified <key> <value> pair in the `di` configuration.
 `di config get    <key>`                    | Gets the value for the specified <key> in the `di` configuration.
 `di config delete <key>`                    | Deletes the specified <key> in the `di` configuration.
 
## Help

All commands have corresponding _help_ text associated with it. To read the help
text for a `di` command, type:

```
di help <command>
```

For example, to display the help text for the `whoami` command:

## .diconf file

All configuration data for your local DeployR CLI install is located in the *.diconf* 
file in your home directory. Directly modifying this file is not advised. You 
should be able to make all configuration changes from the _main menu_ UI or via:

```
di config
```

Example:

```
di config set endpoint http://dhost:port   # set the DeployR server endpoint
```

If you need to have multiple configuration files, use --diconf options.

Example:

```
di --diconf /path/to/other/configuration/.diconf
```

## Options

    di [commands] [options]
 
    --version             prints DeployR version and exit
    --diconf [file]       specify file to load configuration from
    --help                prints cli help and exit

## Tab Completion

**System Requirements**

- bash

Any other shell other than `bash` will simply ignore tab completions. The first
time you run `$ di` from the command line it will add to your `.bashrc` or
`.bash_profile` or .`profile` the necessary hooks. Upon sourcing these files, 
the next time you run `$ di <TAB>` the completions with appear.

Example:

```
$ di lo<TAB>

  login logout

$ di w<TAB>
  
  whoami
```
