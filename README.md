## Overview

[di](https://github.com/deployr/deployr-cli) is a [Command Line Tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for running useful 
[DeployR](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com) utilities. Although the 
current feature set is minimal, many more CLI commands will be added going 
forward.

## Dependencies

_di_ requires:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to be installed.
- A running [DeployR](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/admin/install) server to connect to.

## Installation

_di_ is installed and managed via [npm](http://npmjs.org), the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) package manager.

To get started, you will want to install _di's_ command line interface (CLI) 
globally. You may need to use sudo for (OSX, *nix, BSD, etc). If you are using 
Windows, run your command shell as Administrator.

One-line install using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
npm install -g deployr-cli
```

This will put the `di` command in your system path allowing it to be run from 
any location.

## Usage

`di` is self documenting and the best way to become familiar with the tool is to 
try it out from your command line:

```
di <resource> <action> <param1> <param2> ...
```

## .diconf file

All configuration data for your local `di` install is located in the *.diconf* 
file in your home directory. Directly modifying this file is not advised. You 
should be able to make all configuration changes from the _main menu_ UI or via:

```
di config
```

Example:

```
di config set endpoint http://dhost:port   # set the DeployR server endpoint
```

If you need to have multiple configuration files, use --diconf options.

Example:

```
di --diconf /path/to/other/configuration/.diconf
```

## di options

    di [commands] [options]
 
    --version             prints DeployR version and exit
    --diconf [file]       specify file to load configuration from
    --help                prints cli help and exit
